# Hand-Gesture-Controlled-Car-using-Arduino-RF-Communication
A fully working gesture-controlled robotic car built using Arduino UNO, RF modules, L293D motor driver, and a gesture sensor glove. The car receives wireless signals based on hand movements and responds with real-time motion such as Forward, Backward, Left, Right, and Stop.  This project demonstrates wireless communication, sensor
